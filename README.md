Hello, I am @LeoKaiB.
I’m interested in everything computers and photography.
Currently I am learning basic hacking, arduino's, and better python.
I’m currently not looking to collaborate on anything, I mostly keep my projects to myself or close friends.
You can reach me on reddit, u/Accurate_Pen_4456.
